All the tests in a pachage:

   py.test -v -s




Just one test case: we must apply the next command by sustituying nameofthefunction for some of the text from our name of 

function after test_

   py.test -k nameofthefunction -v -s

For example if our function is "def test_anotherSumForEverybody():" we will apply the next command:

   py.test -k SumForEverybody -v -s



To execute the marked test:

py.test -m mark_name -v -s

Example, if our mark is  @pytest.mark.smoke, then we apply the next command:

py.test -m smoke -v -s


If we want to skip one of the tests, just we must write above the function:
 
@pytest.mark.skip

This test will be skipped at all the time




If we don't want to report one of tests, just we must write above the function:
 
@pytest.mark.xfail

This test will not be reported 



To execute our test with report:

py.test --html=report.html
